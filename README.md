#animated grid traversal

fucking painful code to write, I hate it, so much

I dont know if I missed something but its still >100 lines of code after a painful rewrite and still likely inscerable to others

The basic idea is that you animate the grid in 3 seperate ways, first triangle, middle parrellagram, final triangle;(this is the breakpoints are about)

the 4 vertrexs of the grid are zero,A,B,C

honestly just god help you if you try, this was allot of trail an error to get right, its super fragile
